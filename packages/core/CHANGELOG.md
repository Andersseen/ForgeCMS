### Minor Changes

- 7ec5e67: feat: embeddable content-admin orchestration — collections index, workspace, document editor (spec 052)
  - **`@forge-cms/admin`** gains a content-CRUD orchestration layer on top of the existing
    presentational components: `ForgeCollectionsIndexComponent` (every visible collection with a real
    document count and a link into its workspace), `ForgeCollectionWorkspaceComponent` (owns search,
    sort, status filter, and pagination query state, driving the existing `ForgeCollectionListComponent`
    via `collectionResource()`), `ForgeDocumentEditorComponent` (create/edit via `documentResource()`,
    validation-error mapping, and an unsaved-changes guard exposed as
    `canDeactivateForgeDocumentEditor`), `ForgeConfirmDialogComponent` (a reusable "are you sure?"
    overlay for delete), and `forgeAdminContentRoutes()` (the `collections`/`collections/:collection`
    route subtree, with the create/edit editor rendered as an overlay through the workspace's own
    `<router-outlet>`). `ForgeCollectionFormComponent` gained a `dirtyChange` output.
    `ForgeCollectionListComponent` now shows a title column (driven by a collection's `useAsTitle`)
    instead of always leading with a raw id, and its edit/delete icon buttons gained accessible names.
    None of the existing low-level components changed their own public signatures.
  - **`@forge-cms/core`**: `CollectionDefinition` gains an optional, purely additive
    `admin?: { label?, description?, useAsTitle?, defaultColumns? }` — presentational hints only, never
    validated against document data, never affecting the generated DB schema.
  - **`@forge-cms/runtime`**: `describeCollection` passes `admin.*` through to the client-facing
    `CollectionDescription` (preferring it over the existing slug-humanizing fallback).
  - **`@forge-cms/angular`**: `CollectionMeta` gains `useAsTitle`/`defaultColumns`; `CmsApiService`
    gains `setDocumentStatus()`, a thin convenience wrapper over `updateDocument` for a `drafts: true`
    document's `_status`.

  `apps/www` dogfoods the new layer (`collections.page.ts`/`collection-detail.page.ts` deleted in
  favor of `forgeAdminContentRoutes()`); `apps/demo-aesthetics` is unaffected (all changes are
  additive) and was not migrated. See
  [docs/specs/052-embeddable-content-admin.md](../docs/specs/052-embeddable-content-admin.md).

### Patch Changes

- f88372c: fix: harden auth error semantics, API-key lifecycle, and DB-adapter schema sync (spec 049)
  - **Fixed a severe schema-sync bug**: `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter`, `LibSqlDatabaseAdapter`, and
    `D1DatabaseAdapter` all cleared their internal collection registry on every `syncSchema()` call. When
    `ApiKeyAuthAdapter` shares a `DatabaseAdapter` instance with the main runtime (the documented/tested
    wiring), `ForgeCmsRuntime.syncSchema()` calling `auth.syncSchema?.()` after registering consumer
    collections would wipe them out — breaking every subsequent D1/libSQL operation and silently
    disabling InMemory's unique-constraint enforcement. `syncSchema()` now upserts by slug instead.
  - `CompositeAuthAdapter.requireAuth()` no longer swallows every exception from a child adapter — only
    an expected `ForgeAuthError` falls through to the next strategy; an unexpected error (a DB outage, a
    misconfiguration) propagates instead of becoming a misleading `401`.
  - `@forge-cms/runtime`'s HTTP handlers (`authorize`/`resolveOptionalUser`/`handlePreview`) apply the
    same rule at the boundary that matters most: a non-`ForgeAuthError` from `auth.requireAuth()` now
    surfaces as `500`, not `401` or a silently-anonymous `200`.
  - `AuthAdapter` gains an optional `canHandleToken?(token: string): boolean` — `CompositeAuthAdapter`
    consults it to skip a strategy that obviously doesn't own a token (no DB round-trip, no HMAC verify
    wasted); `ApiKeyAuthAdapter` and the signed-token-based adapters implement it. Fully backward
    compatible — adapters without it are always attempted, exactly as before.
  - `ApiKeyAuthAdapter.createApiKey` now validates input (non-empty `name`, a parseable/future
    `expiresAt`) and normalizes `scopes` (trim, drop empty, dedupe, preserve order). `revokeApiKey` is
    idempotent (preserves the original `revokedAt` rather than sliding it forward). `lastUsedAt` writes
    are throttled (5 min default, `lastUsedAtThrottleMs` option) instead of firing on every request.
  - `_forge_*` is now a reserved collection/global-slug prefix: `defineCollection`/`defineGlobal` reject
    a consumer definition that collides with a Forge-internal system collection like `_forge_api_keys`.
  - No behavior change to human auth, the typed Local API, or any existing adapter contract beyond the
    fixes above.

- d63d93f: feat: nested and/or queries, multi-field sort, findOne, and relation-array membership (spec 050)
  - **Nested boolean queries.** `DatabaseWhere` (`@forge-cms/db`) gains `{ and: [...] }` / `{ or: [...] }`
    groups that nest to arbitrary depth and compose with the existing field operators
    (`eq`/`ne`/`gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte`/`in`/`contains`). Existing flat queries (`{ status: 'published' }`)
    are unchanged and remain valid — `and`/`or` are additive, reserved top-level keys.
    `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` (new `matchesWhere`), `LibSqlDatabaseAdapter` (drizzle `and`/`or`), and
    `D1DatabaseAdapter` (parenthesized parameterized SQL) all implement the same semantics, proven by a
    new shared cross-adapter query contract suite (`runDatabaseAdapterQueryContractTests`,
    `@forge-cms/testing/contracts`).
  - **`findOne()`** on the Local API (`ForgeCmsRuntime`/`operations.ts`, typed and untyped) returns the
    first matching document or `null` instead of throwing — the same access/hooks/drafts/populate
    pipeline as `find()`, with a real database-side `LIMIT 1` (no `count()` call, no fetch-then-slice).
  - **Multi-field sort.** `sort` accepts a field name (unchanged) or `{ field, order }[]` across
    `find`/`findOne` and all three adapters; stable tie-break (first field decides, ties fall through).
  - **Relation-array membership**: a new `containsValue` where-operator, valid only on `relation` fields,
    tests exact-element membership against a `relation({ many: true })` JSON array column —
    `Array.includes` in-process, `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM json_each(...) WHERE value = ?)` on libSQL/D1.
  - **Access-rule security, two fixes**: `mergeWhere` (`@forge-cms/runtime/access.ts`) now nests a
    consumer's `where` under the access constraint as `{ and: [accessConstraint, requestedWhere] }`
    instead of a shallow key-overwrite, so a consumer-supplied `or` can never escape row-level access
    control. Separately — and more seriously, caught by review before merge — an access constraint that
    legitimately resolves to `{ or: [] }` (a natural multi-tenant pattern: "this user belongs to zero
    tenants, so no branch of the read rule can ever be true") used to compile to _no SQL condition at all_
    on `LibSqlDatabaseAdapter`/`D1DatabaseAdapter`, returning every row instead of none — a real
    production auth-bypass on the only shipped SQL adapters, invisible on `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` (which
    already got it right). Both are covered by regression tests, the second one run against a real libSQL
    database, not just InMemory.
  - **Validation, hardened after review**: `find`/`count`/`findOne` share one `validateWhere`/
    `validateSort` gate (`query-validation.ts`) that rejects unknown fields, a genuinely unknown operator
    name (including a typo mixed with a valid operator, e.g. `{ eq: 'a', contians: 'x' }`) while still
    allowing a fully non-operator-shaped object through as a bare equality value (matching a `json` field
    against a literal object — pre-existing, intentional behavior), `containsValue` on a non-relation
    field, and empty `and: []`/`or: []` groups, all as stable `ForgeError`s (400) — no adapter internals
    leak through, and a malformed sort entry (`?sort=[null]`) 400s instead of crashing into a 500.
    `_status` is now a valid sort/filter field on `drafts: true` collections. A `where` object mixing a
    flat key with `and`/`or` at the same level (`{ status: 'x', or: [...] }`) now correctly ANDs both
    instead of the flat key being silently dropped — this affects `matchesWhere` and both SQL builders too,
    not just validation.
  - **HTTP transport**: `?where=<url-encoded JSON>` carries a nested query (size-capped, strictly
    validated, 400 on malformed/oversized/non-object input); `sort=<url-encoded JSON array>` carries a
    multi-field sort. Existing flat `field=value`/`field[op]=value`/`sort=field&order=asc` query strings
    are unchanged.
  - **`@forge-cms/angular`**: `QueryOptions.where`/`sort` accept the same nested/multi-field shapes,
    serialized through the existing shared `buildQueryString` helper (existing flat-query URLs are
    byte-identical); `CmsApiService.findOne()` calls the list endpoint with `limit: 1`, no new server
    route.
  - **Typed Local API**: `TypedWhere` recurses through `and`/`or` keeping field-name narrowing at every
    level; `sort` accepts a typed multi-field list; `findOne` is fully typed.
  - `@forge-cms/core`'s `validateCollectionIdentifiers` now also rejects a field literally named `and`/
    `or` (reserved query keywords), the same way system field names are reserved.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 73050f1: feat: add machine auth (API keys) alongside human auth (spec 048)
  - `@forge-cms/auth` gains `ApiKeyAuthAdapter` — a generic, secure machine-credential primitive.
    Secrets are 256-bit random values from Web Crypto (`crypto.getRandomValues`), never persisted;
    only a SHA-256 digest is stored, compared in constant time. The plaintext secret
    (`<prefix>_<id>_<secret>`, prefix configurable, default `'forge'`) is returned exactly once, at
    creation; `listApiKeys`/`getApiKey` never expose the hash or plaintext. Keys support generic
    `scopes: string[]` and consumer-defined `metadata`, plus `expiresAt`/`revokedAt` — an expired or
    revoked key fails authentication the same generic, non-leaking way an unrecognized one does.
    Persists through the configured `DatabaseAdapter` in an internal system collection
    (`_forge_api_keys`) that is never part of a consumer's `config.collections`, so it cannot be
    reached through generic `/api/v1/*` CRUD.
  - `@forge-cms/auth` gains `CompositeAuthAdapter`, so an application can authenticate human sessions
    and machine API keys through one configured `AuthAdapter` (`new CompositeAuthAdapter([userAuth,
apiKeyAuth])`) with no adapter-specific branching anywhere in `@forge-cms/runtime`.
  - `@forge-cms/auth` gains `hasScope`/`hasAnyScope`/`hasAllScopes` — lightweight helpers over
    `user.scopes`, so existing `access` functions can express `hasScope(user, 'articles:read')`
    exactly like a role check. Scopes are opaque consumer strings; there is no scope-name registry and
    no automatic scope-to-CRUD mapping.
  - `AuthUser` (`@forge-cms/auth`) and the structurally-identical `CmsUser` (`@forge-cms/core`) both
    gain an optional `scopes?: string[]`. `AuthAdapter` gains an optional
    `syncSchema?(): Promise<void>` lifecycle hook, now called by `ForgeCmsRuntime.syncSchema()` — this
    is what lets `ApiKeyAuthAdapter` provision its own table with no manual SQL. Both changes are
    additive and backward compatible; every existing adapter keeps working unchanged.
  - No consumer/domain-specific concepts (projects, catalogs, translations, locales) were added — this
    is a fully generic machine-auth foundation, per the standing rule from spec 044.

- a2c5837: feat: add typed collection Local API (spec 047)
  - `ForgeCmsRuntime` now takes a second, defaulted type parameter that preserves the registered
    collection schemas: `find`/`findByID`/`count`/`create`/`update`/`delete`/`preview` infer typed
    collection slugs (autocomplete + compile-time rejection of unknown slugs), typed write payloads
    (unknown fields/wrong value types are compile errors), and typed returned documents (declared
    fields plus `id`/`created_at`/`updated_at`) — with **zero runtime behavior change**.
  - `@forge-cms/core` gains the small reusable type utilities this relies on: `CollectionRegistry`,
    `CollectionSlug`, `CollectionBySlug`, `CollectionDocument`, `CollectionInput`, `DocumentMeta`,
    reusing `CollectionData`/`InferFields`/`FieldValue` rather than a parallel type system.
  - `defineField.json<TValue>()` is now generic — a compile-time-only annotation that carries a
    consumer-provided type through `CollectionData`/`CollectionDocument` (`defineField.json()` still
    infers `unknown`, exactly as before; no runtime JSON-shape validation is added).
  - `sort` and `where` keys on `find`/`count` are constrained to the collection's declared fields plus
    standard document metadata, so `sort: 'doesNotExist'` is a compile error.
  - Fully backward compatible: a broad/untyped `CollectionDefinition[]` registry, or
    `new ForgeCmsRuntime<TEnv>(...)` given only an environment type, still compiles and still accepts
    any collection string, returning a loosely-typed (not `any`) document — the same shape the Local
    API always returned. Adapters (`DatabaseAdapter`/`D1DatabaseAdapter`/`LibSqlDatabaseAdapter`/
    `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter`) and HTTP handlers required no generic redesign — the handler-facing
    runtime type is pinned to accept any collection registry, since request-time collection slugs are
    plain strings that can never be statically narrowed.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 18f25f8: feat: add collection-level compound indexes and unique constraints (spec 046)
  - `CollectionDefinition` gains `indexes?: { fields: string[]; unique?: boolean }[]` for constraints
    spanning more than one field (field order is the generated column order). Single-field
    `unique`/`index` on a field keep working unchanged.
  - `defineCollection` validates index definitions (empty `fields`, unknown field, duplicated field,
    duplicate equivalent indexes) and rejects them with a clear message.
  - `@forge-cms/db`'s `resolveCollectionIndexes`/`generateIndexSql` centralize deterministic SQL index
    generation (`idx_<collection>_<field...>`), shared by `D1DatabaseAdapter` and `LibSqlDatabaseAdapter`
    so the two SQLite-backed adapters cannot diverge.
  - `InMemoryDatabaseAdapter` now registers collections on `syncSchema` and enforces the same
    single-field and compound unique-index semantics as D1/libSQL (including SQLite's "NULL is never
    equal to NULL" exemption), closing a real dev/test-vs-production gap.
  - A unique conflict from any adapter surfaces as the same typed error: `@forge-cms/db`'s
    `UniqueConstraintError` at the adapter boundary, translated by `@forge-cms/runtime`'s operations
    layer into its own `UniqueConstraintError` (`ForgeError`, `409`, code `UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT`, carrying
    `collection`/`fields`) — the same HTTP handlers that already map every other `ForgeError` need no
    changes to return `409` for it.
  - `@forge-cms/testing/contracts` gains `runDatabaseAdapterConstraintContractTests`, run from all three
    adapters' test suites (InMemory, real libSQL, and a D1 mock that now enforces unique indexes for
    real) to prove identical behavior across adapters.
